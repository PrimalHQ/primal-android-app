- [Ephemerelay](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/ephemerelay) - A Nostr relay that doesn't care about the past
  - Ephemerelay is a Nostr relay implemented in about 100 lines of code.
  - It immediately sends an EOSE for any filter, and then begins returning new events that match. Submitting an event works similarly - it will only be distributed to clients currently connected on that filter.
  - An ephemeral relay can transmit data to clients, who can in turn transmit events to fully-qualified relays that actually store things. Alternatively, you can just use it to chat with your friends who are online.
  - The biggest benefit is not caring about storage space, not caring about spam, and not caring about cost.

### News & Noteworthy
- Plebchain Radio now on podcast platforms including [Fountain](https://fountain.fm/show/0N6GGdZuYNNG7ysagCg9)
- [NDK](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk) launched
  - NDK is a nostr development kit that makes the experience of building Nostr-related applications, whether they are relays, clients, or anything in between, better, more reliable and overall nicer to work with than existing solutions.
  - NDK Objectives:
    - The core goal of NDK is to improve the decentralization of Nostr via intelligent conventions and data discovery features without depending on any one central point of coordination (such as large relays or centralized search providers).
    - NDK team aims to have new to nostr devs get set up, and reading a NIP-01 event within 10 minutes.
    - NDK's objective is to serve prospective, and current nostr devs as clients. If you have friction with the NDK developer experience, please open issues, and ask for help from the NDK team! Devs are encouraged to search through existing, and/or create new github issues when experiencing friction with NDK.
  - New features: NIP-46 support* Ability to pass in an explicit relay set per subscription, Improved filter aggregation logic, New docs website
