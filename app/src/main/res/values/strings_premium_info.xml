    <string name="premium_more_info_faq_third_question">Do I have to use my Primal verified name and lightning address?</string>
    <string name="premium_more_info_faq_third_answer">No. As a Primal Premium user you are able to reserve a Primal Name, but you are not required to use it as your nostr verified address (NIP-05), nor the bitcoin lightning address.

After the subscription expires, there is a grace period of 30 days during which your Primal Name will not be available to others to register. Primal Legend users have non-expiring subscriptions, so they can use their Primal Names indefinitely. Please note that all Primal Names are owned by Primal and rented to users. Primal reserves the right to revoke any name if we determine that the name is trademarked by somebody else, that there is a possible case of impersonation, or for any other case of abuse, as determined by Primal. Please refer to our Terms of Service for details.</string>
